\maketitle
\textit{Note: I had to leave early so some minutes are missing.  Brian Ngo was
  chosen as the interim secretary for spring quarter.}

\topic{Sean Davis}
\begin{itemize}
\item He's our adviser
\item He'll be at our next meeting
\item There'll be a Q\&A afterward
\end{itemize}

\topic{Natasha explains the reimbursement process}
\begin{itemize}
\item There's a form for expenses $<$\$50
\item Everything needs to be an original copy
\item Turn in everything as early as possible
\item Expenses $\ge$\$50 use the department credit card and vendors
\item Announce large expenses in advance (the earlier the better)
\end{itemize}

\topic{Tabling}
\begin{itemize}
\item E-Week on February 24
\item We will hand out flash drives and flyers
\item There will be quiz questions
\item Will we table at Decision Day?
\end{itemize}

\topic{Shirts}
\begin{itemize}
\item Alex is ordering blue shirts through his vendor
\item Preorders, so the expenses do not come out of our budget
\item The department can order clothing but their vendor is more expensive
\end{itemize}

\topic{Discussion: Effectiveness of Facebook ads}
\begin{itemize}
\item Resolved: people are flakes
\item Book club has gotten very low attendance
\item Likewise the last Bit/Byte meetup
\item ``People reached,'' ``people interested,'' and ``people who attend'' decay exponentially
\item If you ask people in person to attend, they are much more likely to do so
\end{itemize}
